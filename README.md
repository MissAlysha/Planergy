# Planergy
Energy-Adaptive Planning for Neurodivergent Workflows

What It Is

Planergy is a planning system that schedules based on fluctuating energy levels instead of fixed time blocks.

Traditional productivity tools assume consistent cognitive output.
Planergy assumes variability.

The Problem

Most planners optimise for time.

But many neurodivergent users (ADHD, autistic, burnout-prone, chronic illness, etc.) experience:
	•	Fluctuating executive function
	•	Variable cognitive bandwidth
	•	Task paralysis from rigid scheduling
	•	Overwhelm from dense interfaces

Time-based planning fails when energy is the real constraint.

⸻

The Approach

Planergy introduces:
	•	Energy-based task tagging (Low / Medium / High cognitive load)
	•	Non-verbal mode (reduced text UI)
	•	Dopamine mapping (quick wins vs heavy tasks)
	•	Adaptive daily reshuffling based on energy state

Instead of asking:
“What time will you do this?”

It asks:
“What can your brain handle right now?”
