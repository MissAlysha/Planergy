**Planergy**

Energy-adaptive planning for fluctuating executive function.

**What It Is**

Planergy is a planning system that schedules around energy levels instead of fixed time blocks.

Traditional tools assume consistent cognitive output.
Planergy assumes variability.

**Core Features**
	• Energy-based task tagging (Low / Medium / High load)
	• Non-verbal mode (reduced text interface)
	• Dopamine mapping (quick wins vs deep work)
	• Adaptive reshuffling based on current energy

**Why I Built This**

I started Planergy during a 48-hour hackathon while I was non-verbal for much of the build.

Most productivity tools assume stable energy and executive function. Mine fluctuates.

Planergy is an experiment in designing work systems that adapt to biological reality instead of idealized output.


**Status**

Prototype. Exploring future directions including adaptive AI scheduling and community features.
